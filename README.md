# Hazardous-gas-detection
PROBLEM STATEMENT : Despite prohibition of hazardous   cleaning of sewers and septic tanks (manual cleaning of sewers and septic tanks without safety kits, safety devices and without adherence to safety precautions) it is still being resorted to in many parts of the country.

Our project aim is to develop an IoT device that will monitor or identify the amount of fatality inside the gases of sewage and septic areas.

SOLUTION:

 *Installation with gas sensors for detecting the specific gases in  septic tanks and sewer.
 
 *The sensors would continuously monitor the various hazardous gases  in real-time and transmit the data to the server.
 
 *The device would trigger an alarm if the gas levels exceed safe thresholds for immediate action.
 
 *Upon receiving the notification, the supervisors can quickly assess the situation and take appropriate action, such as evacuating the worker, providing respiratory support, or calling for emergency assistance.

TECH STACK:

 *Arduino ide

 *Thingspeakserver

 *Nodemcu esp8266 12 E

 *MQ 135

The MQ-135 gas sensor senses gases like ammonia nitrogen, oxygen, alcohols, aromatic compounds, sulfide, and smoke.

ThingSpeak is an open-source Internet of Things (IoT) application and API to store and access information  using the HTTP protocol over the Internet or via a Local Area Network.The gas levels will be displayed in the server once we have set the wifi and API key.
